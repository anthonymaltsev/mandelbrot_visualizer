# Mandelbrot Orbitals Visualizer (A Petri Dish Coughed Upon)

Scheme, I hate your guts  
-- obtuse and complicated --  
But look, pretty points.  

Where the Mandelbrot set is defined as specifically the points that do not escape to infinity when iterated through the function z_next = z^2+c, the Buddhabrot image, which our code takes inspiration from, looks at the paths that points take when they DO escape to infinity. This is not the actual Buddhabrot image, but rather a few of these paths (called orbits), before they escape to infinity. Essentially, a complicated way to produce points that end up looking almost random with some notable patterns. Many think that this image resembles the Buddha.

This was a submission to the Scheme Art Gallery Contest for CS61A Fall 2020 at UC Berkeley. It was awarded 2nd place in the contest. Other submissions can be seen [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/proj/scheme_gallery/)
